A Discord bot running in a django environment. The current version of the bot itself is German, but I might consider adding translations in the future.

Planned features can be found in the [project board](https://github.com/rafaelurben/django-discordbot/projects/1?fullscreen=true).

Feel free to open an issue or start a pull request. ;)
